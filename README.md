# Spam-Detection
This project is a very rudimentary program that uses binary dictionaries and uses the Bayes theorem to determine the probability of an email being either spam or "ham" (not spam).

The Na√Øve Bayes Spam Filter equation takes the probability of a spam occurring (P(A)), the probability of spam not occurring (P(B)), the conditional probability of a spam email occurring, given that a specific email is not spam also occurs (P(A/B)), and the conditional probability of event spam not occurring, given that a specific email is spam also occurs (P(B/A)). This forms into the equation: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

The conditional probability (P(A/B)) is what then determines if the email is considered to be spam or not spam.
